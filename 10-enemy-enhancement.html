      <h1>Enemy Enhancement</h1>
      <section>
        <p>
          The game is now playable, but very short, and pretty boring. In this
          section, we'll generate more enemies when the player has cleared the
          level, and we'll make each enemy more interesting by splitting them
          into smaller enemies and randomizing their toughness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's handle spawning more enemies first. To do this, we'll need to
          know when the last enemy has been destroyed.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-typescript">
            // Game.ts
            private loop = (ms: number): void => {
              // ...
              if (!this.enemies.length) {
                this.spawnEnemies();
                this.projectiles = [];
                this.player.pos = new Vec2(
                  this.ctx.canvas.width / 2,
                  this.ctx.canvas.height / 2
                );
                this.player.vel = new Vec2(0, 0);
              }
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          At the end of each animation frame, we'll check the length of our
          <code class="lang-typescript">enemies</code> array. If it's zero, we
          know that we've destroyed the last enemy. We'll spawn new enemies, get
          rid of any remaining projectiles, and reset the player position and
          velocity. This is the second place we've performed an identical player
          reset, so we'll break it out into a separate function and replace the
          duplicated code.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-typescript">
            private resetPlayer() {
              this.player.pos = new Vec2(
                this.ctx.canvas.width / 2,
                this.ctx.canvas.height / 2
              );
              this.player.vel = new Vec2(0, 0);
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>Let's see what this change does for us.</p>

        <p>
          We're getting somewhere. Let's handle enemy splitting next. We'll
          handle this by assigning each enemy a
          <code class="lang-tyepscript">stage</code> and
          <code class="lang-typescript">scale</code> property. The stage will
          let us know whether to split an enemy or destroy it, and the scale
          will tell us how what size to draw the enemy. We'll also need to add a
          position to the enemy constructor. Right now they all spawn in at
          position (0, 0), but when we split the enemy, we'll want to spawn two
          new enemies at the old enemy's position, not in the corner of the
          canvas.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-typescript">
            // Enemy.ts
            // setup
            baseSize: number = 75;
            radius: number;
            stage: number;
            scale: number;

            constructor(
              ctx: CanvasRenderingContext2D,
              origin: Vec2,
              stage: number,
              scale: number
            ) {
              this.ctx = ctx;
              this.pos = origin;
              this.stage = stage;
              this.scale = scale;
              this.radius = this.baseSize * scale;
              this.vel = Vec2.fromAngle(Math.random() * Math.PI * 2).scale(
                randRange(this.minVel, this.maxVel)
              );
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          The radius is now based on the scale, and we've included a
          <code class="lang-typescript">baseSize</code> so we can easily tweak
          this parameter later if we want. Now we'll need to update our enemy
          spawning and collision detection in
          <code class="lang-markup">Game.ts</code>.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-typescript">
            // Game.ts
            private spawnEnemies(): Enemy[] {
              let enemies = [];
              for (let i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {
                enemies.push(new Enemy(this.ctx, new Vec2(0, 0), 1, 1));
              }
              return enemies;
            }

            private detectCollisions(): void {
              for (let projectile of this.projectiles) {
                for (let enemy of this.enemies) {
                  if (circleCircleCollisionDetected(projectile, enemy)) {
                    enemy.isActive = false;
                    projectile.isActive = false;
                    if (enemy.stage &lt; 3) {

                        this.enemies.push(
                          new Enemy(
                            this.ctx,
                            enemy.pos.copy(),
                            enemy.stage + 1,
                            enemy.scale / 2
                          )
                        );
                      }

          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          When we have hit an enemy with a projectile, we're checking that
          enemy's stage. If it's below 3, (we could choose to parameterize this
          instead of hard coding it), we'll split spawn two new, enemies half
          the size of the parent and one stage higher. You'll notice a new
          vector function here, <code class="lang-typescript">copy</code>. We
          don't want multiple enemies to share the same position vector, since
          we will be altering it, so instead of setting the new enemy's position
          equal to that of the parent, we're going to create a new vector with
          the same x and y values.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-typescript">
            // Vec2.ts
            copy(): Vec2 {
              return new Vec2(this.x, this.y);
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          We've also added an
          <code class="lang-typescript">enemySplitFactor</code> to our game, so
          we can choose how many enemies are split off from a destroyed parent.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-typescript">
            // Game.ts, setup
            enemySplitFactor: number = 2;
          </code>

          This works as expected. The enemies split a set number of times, and
          then are destroyed. Unfortunately, they look a little weird as they
          get smaller. We'll need to scale their line width as we do their
          radius.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-typescript">
            // Enemy.ts, draw
            // ...
            ctx.lineWidth = 3 * this.scale;
            // ...

          Much better. Now we can randomly add some more difficult enemies.
          We'll add a <code class="lang-typescript">requiredHits</code> property
          to our enemies, randomly set with some probability in the constructor,
          and we'll also color the enemy accordingly. Then we'll check to see
          whether there are any more hits required before we destroy an enemy.
        </p>

          Looks pretty good! We've accomplished all our goals for this section.
          While this is certainly better than it was before, the player doesn't
          really have anything new to look forward to when they clear the
          screen. Each wave of enemies is the same size as the last, and there's
          no sense of progress. In the next section, we'll keep track of what
          level we've reached, spawning more and more enemies each time, and
          we'll give the player a score so they can try to beat their personal
          best.
