      <h1>Sparkles and Splats</h1>
      <section>
        <p>
          It's time to add some flavor to our game with a couple of particle
          systems. We're going to create a
          <code class="lang-typescript">Splat</code> effect when we destroy an
          enemy or the player, and we're going to make our player shoot rainbow
          sparkles during propulsion. The
          <code class="lang-typescript">Splat</code> is the simpler of the two,
          so let's knock that one out first. We'll create a new file
          <code class="lang-markup">Splat.ts</code> with two classes,
          <class class="lang-typescript">SplatParticle</class>, our particle
          class, (obviously), and <code class="lang-typescript">Splat</code>,
          our particle system. This is a one-shot system, and won't continually
          generate particles, but will just generate one batch of particles,
          then deactivate after a set time.

          <code class="lang-typescript">SplatParticle</code> has what we've come
          to expect from our game objects, a position, a velocity, an
          <code class="lang-typescript">update</code> method and a
          <code class="lang-typescript">draw</code> method. We're passing a fill
          and stroke color in the constructor, (passed down from the
          <code class="lang-typescript">Splat</code>, which also takes these
          colors in the constructor), so we can create splats of different
          colors. The <code class="lang-typescript">draw</code> method just
          renders a small circle.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code class="lang-typescript">Splat</code> sends our particles flying
          in evenly-distributed directions from the origin point by dividing 2Ï€
          radians by the number of particles, rotating by this amount,
          generating a unit vector from this angle, then scaling it to our
          chosen <code class="lang-typescript">particleSpeed</code>, in a loop.
          We manage the <code class="lang-typescript">lifespan</code> from this
          class rather than the individual particles since we're not
          continuously generating new particles and they all expire at the same
          time.

          We update, draw, and filter our splats along with the player and
          enemies. When we destroy an enemy, we create a splat where the enemy
          had been, and the same for when we destroy the player.

          That's a lot better than the enemies and player just disappearing. Now
          we can work on our rainbow propulsion sparkles.

          This is essentially a part of the player, (activated and deactivated
          by the player, moves in relation to the player), we're going to give
          control of this particle system to the
          <code class="lang-typescript">Player</code> class instead of the
          <code class="lang-typescript">Game</code> class.

        <p>
          We're just taking care of the very basics here. If the player is
          hitting one of the up keys, we're going to activate the sparkles.
          Otherwise, we're going to deactivate the sparkles. (This will
          determine whether we spawn new particles.) We're going to update the
          sparkles system when we update the player and draw the sparkles system
          when we draw the player. To know where to create new sparkles and
          which direction to send them, (this particle system will be
          directional, since we want it to look like a propulsion effect), we'll
          need to supply the sparkles with the current position of the player's
          butt and the current angle of rotation. Hopefully, we've done enough
          work with vectors by now that our method of calculating the player's
          butt position is intuitive.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is all we need on the player's side of things. We'll create a
          file <code class="lang-markdown">Sparkles.ts</code> to hold
          <code class="lang-typescript">Sparkles</code>, (particle system), and
          <code class="lang-typescript">SparkleParticle</code>, (particle),
          classes. Let's start off with the particle.

          The size and selection of colors are shared constants between all
          sparkle particles. We have the usual suspects here, position,
          velocity, lifespan, active/inactive state, and a way of keeping track
          of the amount of time that has passed since the particle was created.
        </p>

              this.lifespan = randRange(0.3, 0.5);

        <p>
          We'll randomly assign a lifespan and color for the particle. The
          reason we're creating a randomized lifespan instead of a fixed one is
          so the particles at the end of our particle trail don't all expire at
          the same time. If we don't do this, we end up with an unpleasant
          squared-off effect.

        <p>
          This is more-or-less identical to our proof of concept. We
          <code class="lang-typescript">update</code> as we do all with all our
          game objects, by adding position to velocity, (no external forces at
          work here), and then we check to see if we have reached our lifespan
          yet. The <code class="lang-typescript">draw</code> method is as simple
          as it gets, drawing a square at the current position.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's all there is to the
          <code class="lang-typescript">SparkleParticle</code>. Let's set up the
          particle system with the
          <code class="lang-typescript">Sparkles</code> class.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-typescript">
            export class Sparkles {
              static angleVariance: number = Math.PI / 6;
              static particleSpeed: number = 200;

              particles: SparkleParticle[] = [];
              spawnRate: number = 5 / 1000; // 5 ms
              lastSpawnTime: number = 0;
              elapsed: number = 0;

          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          This <code class="lang-typescript">angleVariance</code> will be the
          range of angles we can set for our particle velocity when spawning new
          particles. We don't want them all being sent out in a straight line,
          so we'll randomize the angle within a certain range. Everything else
          here is mostly from the proof of concept, only instead of working with
          the <code class="lang-typescript">ms</code> timestamp from
          <code class="lang-typescript">requestAnimationFrame</code> directly,
          we're going to calculate elapsed time based on
          <code class="lang-typescript">dts</code>. The player already has
          access to this variable, but doesn't currently use
          <code class="lang-typescript">ms</code>. We've set up a pretty uniform
          method of updating and drawing all our game objects, and I'd like to
          keep that intact in case we want to perform some refactoring later.
          The constructor is blank.

              for (let particle of this.particles) {

          This is all pretty much exactly how the proof of concept worked. You
          can now see how we use the
          <code class="lang-typescript">isActive</code> flag set by the player
          to turn particle spawning on and off.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-typescript">
            private spawnParticle(pos: Vec2, playerAngle: number): void {
              const minAngle = playerAngle - Sparkles.angleVariance;
              const maxAngle = playerAngle + Sparkles.angleVariance;
              const angle = randRange(minAngle, maxAngle);
              this.particles.push(
                new SparkleParticle(
                  pos.copy(),
                  Vec2.fromAngle(angle, -Sparkles.particleSpeed)
                )
              );
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Here's where that angle variance comes in. We find a min and max angle
          based on the player's current angle, then randomly select an angle in
          that range to send out our new particle. Our
          <code class="lang-typescript">Vec2.fromAngle</code> function is really
          coming in handy today.
        </p>

          And this is all we need to do to create the rainbow butt sparkles
          that, as everyone knows, are the primary propulsion mechanism of all
          magical reindeer. Let's see how this looks.

          Honestly, this is my favorite part of the game so far. I just find it
          really satisfying. The game plays smoothly and it looks pretty nice,
          but it's totally silent. In the next section, we'll work on adding
          some music and sound effects.
