        <p>
          Working in the browser makes this really straightforward. We'll create
          a <code class="lang-markdown">div</code> to hold the content of our
          title screen, which will be shown when the page loads. Our game canvas
          will be hidden. When the player chooses to start the game, (we'll just
          use an "r" keypress, like we do for restarting), we'll hide the title
          screen <code class="lang-markdown">div</code> and show the canvas.
        </p>

          We've got the screen, now we just need to handle that "r" keypress.
          We'll have to move things around a little bit in
          <code class="lang-markup">main.ts</code>.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-typescript">
            // main.ts
            import { Game } from "./Game";
            import "./style.css";

            document.addEventListener("keydown", startGame);

            const titleScreen = document.getElementById("title-screen") as HTMLDivElement;

            function startGame(evt: KeyboardEvent): void {
              if (evt.key === "r") {
                const canvas = document.getElementById("game-canvas") as HTMLCanvasElement;
                canvas.width = 1280;
                canvas.height = 720;
                const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d") as CanvasRenderingContext2D;

                titleScreen.style.display = "none";
                canvas.style.display = "block";

                new Game(ctx).start();

                document.removeEventListener("keydown", startGame);
              }
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Most of this is pretty self-explanatory, but there is one point of
          interest. All our other event listeners in this project have been
          anonymous arrow functions. This one, however, is a named function.
          There's a good reason for this. The last line of this event listener
          is very important. Without it, the user can go on pressing "r" and
          starting up new games until the proverbial cows come home, because the
          document will continue listening for this keypress unless we tell it
          to stop. We've used the
          <code class="lang-typescript">gameOver</code> flag in other parts of
          our code to short circuit event listener behavior, but we don't have
          access to that here. We could add another piece of game state just for
          this, or we could just remove the event listener from the document
          after the game has started. In order to remove an event listener,
          however, you have to call
          <code class="lang-typescript">removeEventListener</code> with the
          <em>exact same arguments</em> that were used for
          <code class="lang-typescript">addEventListener</code>. Same event
          type, same callback. That means we can't use an anonymous function in
          <code class="lang-typescript">addEventListener</code>, because there's
          no way for us to pass that same function to
          <code class="lang-typescript">removeEventListener</code>. Creating a
          named function allows us to use it in both places and tell the
          document to stop listening for this keypress event once the game has
          started.

          This is a big milestone for us! The game is now fully functional. We
          have a title screen, the ability to destroy and be destroyed by
          enemies, levels of increasing difficulty, a score to track our
          performance, and a game over screen that allows us to restart the
          game. From now on, we'll be adding polish to take this game to the
          next level.
