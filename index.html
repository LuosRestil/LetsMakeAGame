      <h1>Welcome</h1>
      <p>
        Hello, and welcome to Let's Make A Game, where we'll make "Rudolph vs The Blobs", <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)">a totally original game that definitely no one has ever thought of before</a>, from the ground up, using HTML Canvas and TypeScript. This game was created for a winter holiday game jam, and so is winter holiday themed, and is scoped to be completed in a short time period with minimal prior experience. This project is intended for someone with some web programming experience who just hasn't made a game before. We'll be writing every line of code together, but we won't be going over the basics of programming in general or HTML/CSS/TypeScript in particular. We <em>will</em> be going into detail about game-specific programming concepts as they arise in our project, like animation/physics, vectors, particle systems, et cetera. The completed code for each lesson can be found in its own branch <a href="https://github.com/LuosRestil/LMAGSource">on GitHub</a>. See you in <a href="00-setup.html">the first lesson</a>!
