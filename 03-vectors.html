      <h1>Vectors</h1>
      <section>
        <p>
          To start with, what are vectors and why are they important to us? In
          the domain we're working in, a vector is a way for us to conceptualize
          motion and/or position. It has built into it the concept of a
          "magnitude" and a "direction". That's all very vague, and an
          illustration will help us a lot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since we're working in two dimensions, we'll represent a vector as a
          set of (x, y) coordinates.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-typescript">
            // Vec2.ts

            export class Vec2 {
              x: number;
              y: number;
            
              constructor(x: number, y: number) {
                this.x = x;
                this.y = y;
              }
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          This is great, because we're already representing our player's
          position as a set of x, y coordinates, so we can drop this straight
          into our player class.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-typescript">
            export class Player {
              width: number = 50;
              height: number = 25;
              pos: Vec2;
              ctx: CanvasRenderingContext2D;
            
              constructor(ctx: CanvasRenderingContext2D) {
                this.ctx = ctx;
                this.pos = new Vec2(ctx.canvas.width / 2, ctx.canvas.height / 2);
              }
              
              // ...
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          We can represent our vector on our coordinate space as an arrow,
          pointing from some origin point, (because we're drawing things on a
          canvas, our origin point is going to be the canvas origin at (0, 0)).
          The way the arrow is pointing is our vector's direction, and its
          length is the magnitude. If we have a vector (3, 4), we could
          represent it like this.
        </p>
        <img src="img/03-vectors/vec-1.png" alt="a vector (3, 4)" />
        <p>
          An important thing to remember about vectors is, unless you're drawing
          something in a coordinate space, <em>the origin doesn't matter</em>.
          We could <em>also</em> represent the same vector like this:
        </p>
        <img src="img/03-vectors/vec-2.png" alt="two equivalent vectors" />
        <p>
          What makes a vector a vector is its <em>magnitude</em> and its
          <em>direction</em>. These two vectors are equivalent, because both of
          them, (gimpy drawing aside), have the same magnitude and are pointing
          in the same direction. They are also represented by the same
          coordinates, (3, 4).
        </p>
        <p>
          How can both of these vectors be (3, 4)? If we draw a point at (3, 4)
          on the screen, it will be at the tip of the red arrow. The tip of the
          blue arrow is god-knows-where. We have to keep in mind that everything
          we draw is relative to the canvas origin. So if our vector's
          coordinates are going to show up on the screen where we expect, we'll
          need to think of them with respect to the canvas origin.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is so useful about vectors is that we can do mathematical
          operations with them. Let's take a look at vector addition.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-typescript">
            static add(v1: Vec2, v2: Vec2): Vec2 {
              return new Vec2(v1.x + v2.x, v1.y + v2.y);
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Pretty simple, right? We just add the x coordinates to each other and
          the y coordinates to each other. While simple, it offers us some
          pretty useful capabilities. Let's take a look at what this looks like
          in practice.
        </p>
        <img src="img/03-vectors/vec-3.png" alt="adding vectors" />
        <p>
          Adding vectors is essentially chaining them together. If we add the
          red vector (3, 5) and the blue vector (2, -2), we end up at (5, 3),
          represented by the green vector. Why is this useful? We can use this
          to represent forces acting on objects on the screen! If we have an
          object at (3, 5) and a strong wind pushes it (2, -2), it will end up
          at (5, 3).
        </p>
        <p>
          You'll notice that vector addition, like regular addition is
          commutative. If we were to draw the blue vector from the origin and
          put the red vector on the end of it, the green vector would stay the
          same.
        </p>
        <p>
          Subtraction is just as easy as addition, and offers up some more very
          helpful functionality.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-typescript">
            static subtract(v1: Vec2, v2: Vec2): Vec2 {
              return new Vec2(v1.x - v2.x, v1.y - v2.y);
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <img src="img/03-vectors/vec-4.png" alt="vector subtraction" />
        <p>
          This visual representation of vector subtraction demonstrates a handy
          technique. Let's call the red vector the position of objectA, and the
          blue vector the position of objectB. objectA's position minus
          objectB's position gives us a vector that points from objectB to
          objectA!
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as we can visualize vector addition by appending one vector onto
          the end of another, we can visualize vector subtraction in a similar
          way. If we have two vectors A and B and we are performing A minus B,
          we can append B onto the end of A,
          <em>then reverse its direction</em>, and this will give us the result.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note, just like regular subtraction, vector subtraction is
          <em>not</em> commutative. The order we perform the subtraction
          matters. One way will give us a vector pointing from objectA to
          objectB, and the other will give us a vector pointing from objectB to
          objectA.
        </p>
        <img src="img/03-vectors/vec-5.png" alt="more vector subtraction" />
        <p>
          Just a few more vector operations should be sufficient for us to
          implement our desired character movement. (Indeed, we don't even need
          subtraction for this, it's just good to know about).
        </p>
        <p>
          Vector scaling is increasing or decreasing the magnitude by a certain
          factor. Really, it's just multiplication. Scaling by a factor of 2
          will double the magnitude, while scaling by a factor of 0.5 will cut
          it in half.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-typescript">
            static scale(vec: Vec2, factor: number): Vec2 {
              return new Vec2(vec.x * factor, vec.y * factor);
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Normalization is scaling a vector such that its magnitude becomes 1.
          (A vector with a magnitude of 1 is known as a "unit vector"). This
          greatly simplifies some calculations for us. To do this, we'll divide
          the vector by its magnitude, (or in practice, we'll scale it by one
          divided by its magnitude). Of course, we'll first need to
          <em>find</em> the vector's magnitude. We can do this with the
          Pythagorean Theorem.
        </p>
        <img src="img/03-vectors/get-mag.png" alt="getting vector magnitude" />
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-typescript">
            mag(): number {
              return Math.sqrt(this.x ** 2 + this.y ** 2);
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>Now we can perform the normalization.</p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-typescript">
            normalize(): Vec2 {
              const mag = this.mag();
              return this.scale(1 / mag);
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          We're doing a lot of manipulation of a vector's magnitude. Sometimes
          we just want to set the magnitude to some known value. For example,
          let's say we want our player to shove an enemy away with some magical
          force. (Not this game, obviously). We could subtract the player's
          position from the enemy's, giving us a vector pointing from the player
          to the enemy, but now we want to set our push force to the character's
          pushForce statistic. We can set the magnitude of a vector by combining
          normalization and scaling.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-typescript">
            setMag(mag: number): Vec2 {
              return this.normalize().scale(mag);
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          You'll notice when we defined
          <code class="lang-typescript">scale</code> a moment ago, it was a
          static method, while <code class="lang-typescript">setMag</code> uses
          an instance version of this. I've created static and instance methods
          for most of these functions so we can choose whether to create new
          vectors or modify existing ones. The instance methods return
          <code class="lang-typescript">this</code> so that we can perform
          chained operations like this one. Let's proceed with our magical force
          push.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-typescript">
            // vector pointing from player to enemy
            const force = Vec2.subtract(enemy.position, player.position);
            force.setMag(player.pushForce);
            enemy.position.add(force);
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Hopefully the pieces are starting to fit into place, and you can see
          how we're going to end up controlling our onscreen objects with
          vectors. In the next lesson, we'll put what we've learned into
          practice and finalize the movement for our player.
