        <p>
          It's time for us to take control over our player. Let's make a class
          to encapsulate our player's attributes and behavior.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-typescript">
            export class Player {
              width: number = 50;
              height: number = 25;
              ctx: CanvasRenderingContext2D;
            
              constructor(ctx: CanvasRenderingContext2D) {
                this.ctx = ctx;
              }
            
              draw() {
                // our drawing code from earlier...
                // don't forget to add "this." to ctx, width, and height
                // canvas will now be this.ctx.canvas
              }
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>Now we can use this in <code class="lang-markup">main.ts</code>.</p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-typescript">
            import { Player } from "./Player";

            // canvas setup here...

            const player = new Player(ctx);
            player.draw();
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          This gets us exactly where we were before, but now we've made our code
          a little more manageable.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we're going to control our player, it's going to have to be
          animated. This means we'll have to draw the player to the screen at
          its current position, calculate a new position, then clear the screen
          and draw the player at that position, and repeat ad infinitum, or ad
          nauseum, whichever comes first. Let's give the player a position to
          start with, so we can control where it's drawn.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-typescript">
            export class Player {
              width: number = 50;
              height: number = 25;
              pos: {x: number, y: number};
              ctx: CanvasRenderingContext2D;
            
              constructor(ctx: CanvasRenderingContext2D) {
                this.ctx = ctx;
                this.pos = {
                  x: ctx.canvas.width / 2,
                  y: ctx.canvas.height / 2
                }
              }
            
              draw() {
                this.ctx.save();
                this.ctx.translate(this.pos.x, this.pos.y);
                // our existing drawing code...
                this.ctx.restore();
              }
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Notice that we're also saving and restoring our canvas context
          properties before we draw our character. Because we're going to be
          drawing this over and over in a loop, if we don't reset our
          transformation, the canvas will be shifted again and again relative to
          its previous transformation and our origin will end up far away from
          where we intend it. By saving and restoring, the transform will be
          reset back to its original (0, 0) position as soon as we're done
          drawing, and on the next iteration of the loop we'll be able to easily
          shift back to the player's position.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we can create our animation loop. There are lots of ways to do
          this, but there's one that's built into JavaScript specifically for
          the kind of thing we're trying to accomplish.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-typescript">
            // main.ts
            
            // ...

            requestAnimationFrame(animate);

            function animate() {
              requestAnimationFrame(animate);
              ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
              player.draw();
              player.pos.x += 0.5;
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          <code class="lang-markup">requestAnimationFrame</code> allows us to
          provide a callback function to be executed in a loop, usually at the
          refresh rate of the user's display. If the code in the callback takes
          longer to execute, it will wait until the code has finished running,
          then run the next frame. Here, we are doing as we described earlier,
          clearing the drawing surface from the last frame, drawing the player
          at its new position, then calculating the next position.
        </p>

        </video>
        <p>
          We're moving! There's one more thing we'll need to take into account,
          however. Remember what we said about
          <code class="lang-markup">requestAnimationFrame</code> looping at the
          refresh rate of the user's monitor? That means if someone has a 60
          frames per second refresh rate and someone else has a 120 frames per
          second refresh rate, our function is going to be called twice as many
          times on the second person's machine, and our player will move twice
          as far. This presents a problem, because we want our game to look and
          feel the same for everyone, regardless of what machine they're playing
          on. To address this, we're going to scale all movements in our game
          relative to the amount of time that has passed between each frame.
          That way if you have double the refresh rate, the time difference
          between each frame will be half as long, and we'll only move the
          objects on screen half as far.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code class="lang-markup">requestAnimationFrame</code> helps us
          achieve this. When it calls our callback function, it does so with one
          argument, which is a timestamp in milliseconds since the start of the
          loop. We can add that argument to our callback function.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-typescript">
            function animate(ms: number)
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Then we can figure out how much time has passed by keeping track of
          the previous frame's timestamp and subtracting it from the current
          one.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-typescript">
            // ... getting our canvas context ...
            let lastTime = 0;
            const speed = 100;
  
            const player = new Player(ctx);
  
            requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  
            function animate(ms: number) {
              requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  
              const dt = ms - lastTime;
              const dts = dt / 60;
  
              ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
              player.draw();
              player.pos.x += speed * dts;
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          <code class="lang-markup">dt</code> stands for "delta time", the
          "delta" (difference) between the previous time and the current time.
          Because this time is in milliseconds, we're creating another variable
          <code class="lang-typescript">dts</code>, "delta time (in) seconds",
          allowing us to think about our movements in terms of units per second.
          For example, the speed variable we've created represents pixels per
          second.
          <!-- If we have a 60 fps refresh rate, our delta time per frame is going to be (rounding) 16.7ms. This makes our delta time in seconds about 0.0167. Each frame, we'll multiply our speed, 100, by this delta time in seconds, giving us about 1.67 pixels per frame. Multiply this by the 60 frames we have in a second, and you get 100.2 pixels, (tiny error from rounding at the start).  -->
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we understand the basic mechanics of animation, let's give
          ourselves some control over the player. To do this, we'll need to
          respond to key presses, WASD and/or the arrow keys. Instead of
          hard-coding movement into our animation, we'll check to see what keys
          are being pressed and we'll move the character based on that
          information. Unfortunately, JavaScript and the browser don't have a
          way of checking what keys are down at any given moment. What we do
          have access to are <code class="lang-markup">keydown</code> and
          <code class="lang-markup">keyup</code> events. By keeping track of
          when a player has pressed a key and when they have released it, we can
          extrapolate when a key is held. Let's do that now.
        </p>
        <p>First, we need an object to hold our keypress data.</p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-typescript">
            const keys = {
              up: false,
              down: false,
              left: false,
              right: false,
            };
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Next, we'll need to listen for and respond to keydown and keyup
          events.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-typescript">
            document.addEventListener("keydown", (evt) => {
              const key = evt.key;
              switch (key) {
                case 'ArrowUp':
                case 'w':
                  keys.up = true;
                  break;
                case 'ArrowDown':
                case 's':
                  keys.down = true;
                  break;
                case 'ArrowLeft':
                case 'a':
                  keys.left = true;
                  break;
                case 'ArrowRight':
                case 'd':
                  keys.right = true;
                  break;
              } 
            });
            
            document.addEventListener("keyup", (evt) => {
              const key = evt.key;
              switch (key) {
                case 'ArrowUp':
                case 'w':
                  keys.up = false;
                  break;
                case 'ArrowDown':
                case 's':
                  keys.down = false;
                  break;
                case 'ArrowLeft':
                case 'a':
                  keys.left = false;
                  break;
                case 'ArrowRight':
                case 'd':
                  keys.right = false;
                  break;
              } 
            });
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Now in our animation loop, we can check to see which keys are pressed
          and move our character accordingly.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-typescript">
            if (keys.up) player.pos.y -= speed * dts;
            if (keys.down) player.pos.y += speed * dts;
            if (keys.left) player.pos.x -= speed * dts;
            if (keys.right) player.pos.x += speed * dts;
          </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
          Of course, since our game is taking place in space, this is not the
          kind of movement we're actually going to employ. Instead, we're going
          to steering ourselves and moving with a propulsion force, with the
          continuous, frictionless momentum of the vast void of the cosmos. For
          this, we'll employ Euler integration and vectors.
