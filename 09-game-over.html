      <h1>Game Over</h1>
      <section>
        <p>
          Whenever our player runs into an enemy, it will need to be destroyed,
          and we'll need to show a "Game Over" screen, with the option to play
          again. We'll handle all this with a simple
          <code class="lang-typescript">gameOver</code> flag added to our
          <code class="lang-typescript">Game</code> class. We'll use this as a
          switch to disable collision detection and the drawing of our player,
          as well as to enable the drawing of our Game Over screen and our
          restart functionality.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-typescript">
            // Game.ts
            // setup...
            gameOver: boolean = false;

            // detectCollisions
            if (collisionDetected) {
              this.gameOver = true;
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          We've removed the placeholder background color change behavior that we
          were using to visualize collision detection, setting our new
          <code class="lang-typescript">gameOver</code> flag instead. Now we can
          use this to disable anything that we don't want to happen when the
          game is over and to show the game over screen. Let's start by hiding
          the player.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-typescript">
            // Game.ts
            private draw(): void {
              // ...
              if (!this.gameOver) this.player.draw();
              // ...
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>That was easy! Let's see how it worked.</p>

        <p>
          Well, the player is hidden, but can still fire projectiles, and the
          enemies can still be destroyed. Let's disable those things as well.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-typescript">
            // Player.ts
            document.addEventListener("keydown", (evt) => {
              if (this.game.gameOver) return;
              // ...
            }


            // Game.ts
            private loop = (ms: number): void => {
              // ...
              if (!this.gameOver) this.detectCollisions();
            };
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Much better. We now technically have game over functionality. It's not
          pretty, but it works. Let's make it better by adding a Game Over
          screen.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-typescript">
            // Game.ts
            private draw(): void {
              // ...
              if (this.gameOver) {
                this.showGameOver();
              }
            }

            private showGameOver(): void {
              // overlay
              this.ctx.fillStyle = "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)";
              this.ctx.fillRect(0, 0, this.ctx.canvas.width, this.ctx.canvas.height);
          
              this.ctx.fillStyle = "crimson";
              this.ctx.strokeStyle = "darkred";
              this.ctx.lineWidth = 5;
              this.ctx.font = "64px monospace";
              this.ctx.textAlign = "center";
              this.ctx.strokeText(
                "GAME OVER",
                this.ctx.canvas.width / 2,
                this.ctx.canvas.height / 2 - 50
              );
              this.ctx.fillText(
                "GAME OVER",
                this.ctx.canvas.width / 2,
                this.ctx.canvas.height / 2 - 50
              );
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <video muted controls>

        <p>
          There, a proper Game Over screen. We make a transparent overlay and
          print our game over text on it, leaving straggling projectiles and the
          victorious enemies floating around in the background for a little
          visual interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we've done our job in making the game fun, our players aren't going
          to want to stop here. They'll want to play again. Right now, the only
          way to do that is to refresh the browser. Not a great user experience.
          Let's give the player an option to play again.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, we'll display some text to let them know they can do this, just
          underneath our game over text.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-typescript">
            this.ctx.fillStyle = "white";
            this.ctx.strokeStyle = "black";
            this.ctx.font = "48px monospace";
            this.ctx.strokeText(
              'Press "R" to play again',
              this.ctx.canvas.width / 2,
              this.ctx.canvas.height / 2 + 50
            );
            this.ctx.fillText(
              'Press "R" to play again',
              this.ctx.canvas.width / 2,
              this.ctx.canvas.height / 2 + 50
            );
          </code>
        </pre>
        <img src="img/09-game-over/play-again.png" alt="play again text" />
        <p>Now we have to actually handle the "R" keypress.</p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-typescript">
            // Game.ts
            // in the constructor
            document.addEventListener("keydown", (evt) => {
              if (this.gameOver && evt.key === "r") {
                this.refresh();
              }
            });

            private refresh(): void {
              this.projectiles = [];
              this.spawnEnemies();
              this.player.pos = new Vec2(
                this.ctx.canvas.width / 2,
                this.ctx.canvas.height / 2
              );
              this.player.vel = new Vec2(0, 0);
              this.gameOver = false;
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          We've added a keydown listener in the constructor of our
          <code class="lang-typescript">Game</code> class to listen for an "r"
          keypress when the <code class="lang-typescript">gameOver</code> flag
          is set. (If we omit this
          <code class="lang-typescript">gameOver</code> check, we can restart
          the game at any time with the "r" key, and we don't want that.) This
          triggers our <code class="lang-typescript">refresh</code> process,
          clearing any remaining projectiles, spawning a fresh batch of enemies,
          resetting our player's position and velocity, (remember, we haven't
          actually destroyed our player, just hidden them), and un-setting our
          <code class="lang-typescript">gameOver</code> flag to reactivate all
          the game functionality we disabled. Let's give it a try.
        </p>

        <p>
          Perfect! I think we're good here. When our player is hit, we disable
          gameplay, show a reasonable game over screen, and let the player
          restart with the "r" button.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is another "end" to the game we haven't considered just yet. If
          our player manages to destroy all the enemies, there's nothing more
          for them to do. The game doesn't end, but we also don't generate any
          more enemies. In the next section, we'll expand the game play by
          creating more enemies when the level is cleared. We'll also want to
          make each individual enemy more interesting by splitting into smaller
          enemies after being hit, until a certain size is reached, at which
          time they'll be destroyed. We'll also add durability to enemies,
          randomly making some enemies more difficult to defeat. See you in the
          next section!
