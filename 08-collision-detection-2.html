        <p>
          Determining the distances between circles is very straightforward.
          It's just the distance from between their centers minus their radii.
          But how do you find the distance between a circle and a rectangle? A
          rectangle doesn't have a radius. The distance from the outside edge to
          the center varies depending on <em>where</em> on the edge we're
          calculating from. It's kind of a tricky problem, but in our
          description of the problem, we've already begun to get some idea of
          how this might work. We have to find out what point on the rectangle
          is closest to the circle. Then we can get the distance between this
          point and the center of the circle. If that distance is smaller than
          the circle's radius, we know that point is inside the circle, and the
          shapes must be touching.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finding the closest point on an arbitrarily rotated rectangle,
          however, is quite a bit easier said than done. (This rotated rectangle
          is generally referred to as an Oriented Bounding Box, and we'll use
          this term, abbreviated "OBB", moving forward.) It's a good bit easier
          to find the closest point on a rectangle with <em>no</em> rotation,
          (an Axis-Aligned Bounding Box, or "AABB" from here on), so we'll start
          with that to get the general ideas under our belts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's build out a proof of concept. We'll start with some boilerplate
          and helper functions.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-javascript">
            // setup
            const canvas = document.querySelector("canvas");
            const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

            const aabb = {
              x: canvas.width / 2,
              y: canvas.height / 2,
              w: 300,

            };

            const circle = {
              x: 200,

            }

            function dist(x1, y1, x2, y2) {
              return Math.sqrt((x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2);

        <p>
          Just as with our circle-circle collision proof of concept, we have our
          drawing surface, shapes, mouse control, and an animation loop. We have
          helper functions to make drawing circles and lines easier, (maybe we
          should use these in our main project...), and a bunch of math helper
          functions. Most of this is the exact same vector stuff that we have in
          our main project, just without the
          <code class="lang-typescript">Vec2</code> class, representing vectors
          as a 2d array rather than an object with x and y coordinates. We're
          just hashing stuff out here.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two things that you will not have seen to this point. The
          first is the <code class="lang-javascript">clamp</code> function. What
          this does is fit a given value into a min-max range. So, for example,
          if we pass it a value of 5, a min of 1 and a max of 10, it just return
          our value, 5, since 5 already falls in the given range. But if we
          passed a value of -1 with the same min and max, we'd get back a 1,
          since it will raise our value up to the minimum. Similarly, a value of
          100 with the same min and max would return 10, since that's the max.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second is the the
          <code class="lang-javascript">dot</code> function, which gives us the
          "dot product" of two vectors. This is just the x values multiplied
          together plus the y values multipled together. We'll see what this
          does for us when we move on to working with the OBB.
        </p>
        <p>Let's work out what we want to do in our animation loop.</p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-javascript">
            function animate() {
              requestAnimationFrame(animate);
      
              // set styles
              ctx.fillStyle = "black";
              ctx.strokeStyle = "white";
              ctx.lineWidth = 5;
              ctx.textAlign = "left";
              ctx.font = "24px monospace";
      
              // draw background
              ctx.fillRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
      
              // draw shapes
              ctx.strokeRect(
                aabb.x - aabb.w / 2,
                aabb.y - aabb.h / 2,
                aabb.w,
                aabb.h
              );
              drawCircle(circle.x, circle.y, circle.r, false, true);
              // center of circle
              ctx.fillStyle = 'white';
              drawCircle(circle.x, circle.y, 5);
      
              const collisionDetected = aabbCircleCollisionDetected(aabb, circle);
              const text = collisionDetected ? "COLLISION DETECTED" : "...";
              ctx.fillStyle = "white";
              ctx.fillText(text, 50, 50);

          Simple enough. We set some styles, draw our shapes, then check for a
          collision, writing a status message based on what we found. Time for
          the fun stuff. Let's make our collision detection function.
        </p>

        <p>
          To find the nearest point on the AABB to our circle, we have to find
          where the circle lies in relation to the rectangle for each axis. I
          know that probably doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but it becomes a
          lot clearer when we see it in action.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-javascript">
            function aabbCircleCollisionDetected(aabb, circle) {
              // calculate stuff

              ctx.strokeStyle = 'limegreen';
              ctx.setLineDash([5, 15]);
              drawLine(aabb.x, aabb.y, circle.x, aabb.y);
              drawLine(aabb.x, aabb.y, aabb.x, circle.y);
              ctx.setLineDash([]);
              
              ctx.fillStyle = "red";
              drawCircle(circle.x, aabb.y, 10);

              ctx.fillStyle = "dodgerblue";
              drawCircle(aabb.x, circle.y, 10);

        <p>
          The red dot represents where the circle sits in relation to the
          rectangle's x axis. The blue dot represents where the circle sits in
          relation to the rectangle's y axis. We're just focusing on each axis
          separately, one at a time. You can see that since the rectangle is to
          the left of the rectangle (x axis), the red dot is to the left. Since
          the circle is above the circle, (y axis), the blue dot is above.
        </p>
        <img
          src="img/08-collision-detection-2/aabb-4.png"
          alt="axis projections again"
        />
        <p>
          Here you can see the red dot only extends partially across the
          rectangle, because the circle's x position sits within the rectangle
          on the x axis.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope it's now clear what we mean when we say we have to find where
          the circle lies in relation to the rectangle. What we eventually want
          to know is where the nearest point on the square is, and we do this by
          finding the nearest point <em>on each axis</em>, then using that to
          determine our final nearest point.
        </p>
        <p>
          When our circle is far away from the rectangle on either axis, the
          red/blue dot extends far beyond the boundaries of the rectangle. We're
          interested in finding the nearest point on each axis <em>on</em> the
          square, so we have to <code class="lang-javascript">clamp</code> these
          points to the square's boundaries.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-javascript">
            function aabbCircleCollisionDetected(aabb, circle) {
              // calculate stuff
              const nearestX = clamp(circle.x, aabb.x - aabb.w / 2, aabb.x + aabb.w / 2);
              const nearestY = clamp(circle.y, aabb.y - aabb.h / 2, aabb.y + aabb.h / 2);
              // draw stuff
              // ...
              ctx.fillStyle = "red";
              drawCircle(nearestX, aabb.y, 10);

              ctx.fillStyle = "dodgerblue";
              drawCircle(aabb.x, nearestY, 10);
            }

        <img
          src="img/08-collision-detection-2/aabb-5.png"
          alt="clamped axis projection"
        />
        <p>
          Now you can see that even though the circle is quite far away from the
          rectangle, the dots are not extending outside its boundaries.
        </p>
        <img
          src="img/08-collision-detection-2/aabb-6.png"
          alt="clamped axis projections again"
        />
        <p>
          Since <code class="lang-javascript">clamp</code> just gives us back
          the value we passed in if it falls within the given min-max range, you
          can see that the red dot still sits partially along the rectangle's x
          axis when the circle sits within the rectangle on that axis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we have the closest point to the circle on the x and y axes, and
          that's all the information we need! The combination of these two
          things is our goal, the closest point on the rectangle to the circle.

          You can see that as we move our circle around the rectangle, the
          yellow circle follows around, showing us the closest point on the
          square. The final step of collision detection here is simple. We just
          need to find out how far that point is from our circle. If that
          distance is smaller than our circle's radius, it must be within our
          circle, and we have a collision!

          Now we are successfully detecting collisions between an AABB and a
          circle! Armed with an understanding of this process, we're ready to
          tackle the problem with an OBB.

          At a high level, this will work exactly the same way as the AABB.
          We're going to find the nearest point on the rectangle to the circle
          and check the distance. And to do this, we're going to find the
          nearest point on the x axis and the nearest point on the y axis.
          <em>BUT...</em> These axes are not the axes of the canvas. They will
          instead be the <em>local</em> axes of the OBB. Again, this is a tough
          thing to conceptualize, so we're going to visualize each step of the
          process.

          Here we can see what we mean by the rectangle's "local" axes!. Just as
          with our AABB, the red line is the rectangle's x axis and the blue
          line is the y axis.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code class="lang-javascript">localXAxis</code> and
          <code class="lang-javascript">localYAxis</code> variables are unit
          vectors, calculated much as we calculated the propulsion force
          direction for our player. Now, you'll notice that when we're drawing
          the representation of these axes on the screen, we're not drawing the
          vectors as-is. This is for a couple of reasons. For one thing, a unit
          vector is only going to be one pixel long, so it won't show up on the
          screen unless we scale it. In this case, we're actually scaling it in
          two directions so it takes up the whole width/height of the square.
          For another, we have to move the origin of this vector to the middle
          of the rectangle by adding the rectangle's position vector. As always,
          a vector is just a magnitude and direction, and when we draw it as a
          position on the canvas, we have to take its origin into account if we
          want it to be drawn where we expect. You'll see this over and over as
          we are drawing the vectors used in our calculations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now it's time to work out how to find the closest point on the
          rectangle on its local x and y axes. First, we'll get a vector
          pointing from the OBB to the circle. (Remember that we can do this
          with subtraction).
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-javascript">

            const D = subtract(circlePos, obbPos); // vector pointing from obb to circle

          Having this vector allows us to perform a great trick. Using the dot
          product of two vectors allows us to "project" one vector upon another.
          The formula for this is
          <code class="lang-typescript"
            >dot(vector1, vector2) / mag(vector2)</code
          >Let's look at an illustration.
        </p>
        <img
          src="img/08-collision-detection-2/projection-1.png"
          alt="scalar projection"
        />
        <p>
          Imagine we are shining a light perpendicular to one of our vectors,
          (the blue one, in this illustration). The dot product of the two
          vectors represents the "shadow", if you will, of one vector, (the
          red), upon the other, (the blue), represented here by the dotted green
          line. This shadow illustration helps us conceptualize the concept, but
          to be more precise, the dot product gives us a scalar value that tells
          us the length along a local axis that is shared by both vectors. In
          this case, the local axis we're talking about is the blue vector, and
          the dotted green line is the length that is shared. This scalar value
          is known as the "scalar projection" of one vector upon another. We can
          use this scalar projection to create a vector if we choose, which is
          called the "vector projection". In this case, we would make a unit
          vector with the same direction as the blue vector, then we'd scale it
          by the dot product.
        </p>
        <p>
          We talked about this "shared" length along a local axis, but what
          happens when we have an angle between two vectors that is greater than
          90 degrees? We won't have any shared length. This can be a little
          confusing, but it's really nothing for us to get hung up on. In this
          case, it just happens that the dot product will be <em>negative</em>,
          (less than zero shared space, because one vector covers space along
          the local axis that the other does not), and we can continue to
          visualize the relationship between the vectors in the same way.
        </p>

        <p>
          We used some key phrasing a moment ago. We said the dot product gives
          us the length <em>along a local axis</em> that is shared by both
          vectors. Since we're working with the local axes of an OBB, that
          sounds like exactly what we need to find our nearest x and y points in
          the OBB's local space. Let's give this a shot.

          You can see how we've projected our D vector onto the local axes of
          the rectangle. You'll notice you don't see exactly the formula that we
          showed earlier for calculating scalar projection. We've left off the
          division part. Since the magnitude of the vector we're projecting onto
          is 1, it won't have any affect on our calculation. Comparing this
          illustration to our AABB's diagram at this stage should look
          <em>very</em> familiar:

          alt="aabb axis projections"
        />
        <p>
          We can now see how far along each local axis the circle is, just as we
          did with the AABB. And the next step is also the same. We need to
          clamp these values to the boundaries of the rectangle. We'll then have
          one extra step that we didn't have to take with the AABB. Since the
          axes are vectors, we'll have to scale them by our clamped scalar
          projections, (making a vector projection), to find the nearest x and y
          values in the rectangle's local space.

          Again, very familiar looking. We have our x and y values in the

          We have been working with vectors without any respect to their origin,
          making all our calculations in a conceptual "local space" to the
          rectangle. To use our final result as a point on our canvas that we
          can get a distance measurement for, we have to move its origin to the
          rectangle. (We've been doing this already for every drawing we've done
          so that our lines and circles would show up on/around the rectangle
          instead of way off in the top left corner of the canvas.)

        <p>
          We can now add our nearest point to our rectangle for a final
