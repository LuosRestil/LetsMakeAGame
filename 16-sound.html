      <h1>Sound</h1>
      <section>
        <p>
          The most difficult part of adding sound to our game is sourcing
          assets. There are lots of different actions and events in our game
          that should have a sound, and we have to either find or create a sound
          for all of these. Here's
          <a
            href="https://github.com/kobitoko/Game-Jam-Tools-Resources#sound-resources"
            >a very helpful GitHub repo</a
          >
          for finding or creating game assets, including sounds and music. I've
          chosen to source mostly from
          <a href="freesound.org">freesound.org</a>. Thinking through our game,
          we'll need sounds for:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>firing cookies</li>
          <li>damaging a tough enemy</li>
          <li>splitting an enemy</li>
          <li>splatting an enemy</li>
          <li>splatting the player</li>
          <li>reaching a new level</li>
          <li>sparkles</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And we'll need music for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>loading screen</li>
          <li>gameplay</li>
          <li>game over screen</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Some of the sounds I found required editing, either to create a smooth
          loop (for music) or to trim leading/trailing silences. If you have no
          experience with audio editing,
          <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a> is a reasonably
          user-friendly, cross-platform tool you can use to perform simple tasks
          like these.
        </p>
        <p>
          We'll be storing our sound files in a folder named
          <code class="lang-typescript">public</code>. If we don't do this,
          we'll have to import them as modules to be processed and imported by
          our build tool. Using the public folder just simplifies serving and
          referencing these files.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once we have our sounds, adding them into the game and using them
          isn't such a big deal. We have a couple of options available to us. We
          can use the
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API"
            >Web Audio API</a
          >, (kind of complicated), or HTML Audio elements, (very simple). For
          really high performance and customization, the Web Audio API is
          probably the way to go, but the easier option suits our needs just
          fine.
        </p>
        <p>Let's start with our main game music.</p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-typescript">
            // Game.ts
            // setup
            mainSong: HTMLAudioElement = new Audio("main-song.ogg");

            // constructor
            // ...
            this.mainSong.loop = true;
            this.mainSong.volume = 0.4;
            this.mainSong.play();
            // ...
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          I'm sure you can guess what each part of this does. We're creating an
          HTML Audio element, with our sound file as the source. The
          <code class="lang-typescript">loop</code> property will cause the song
          to start playing again from the beginning once the end of the file is
          reached. The volume property... sets the volume. My file was quite
          loud, so I've lowered the volume so it's not so overwhelming. Last,
          the <code class="lang-typescript">play</code> method does what it says
          on the box, plays our song.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the player is wiped out, we'll want to stop the song. And we'll
          want to start it up again if the player restarts.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-typescript">
            // Game.ts
            private detectCollisions(): void {
              // ...
              if (collisionDetected) {
                this.splats.push(new Splat(this.player.pos.copy(), "crimson", "darkred"));
                this.gameOver = true;
                this.mainSong.pause();
                this.mainSong.currentTime = 0;
              }
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          <code class="lang-typescript">pause</code> is as self-explanatory as
          <code class="lang-typescript">play</code>. The
          <code class="lang-typescript">currentTime</code> property sets the
          playback position of the audio, (in seconds). We're setting this to
          zero so that the next time we call
          <code class="lang-typescript">play</code>, (when the player restarts),
          we'll be at the start of the song instead of whatever part of the song
          we happened to be at when the player died. Speaking of which:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-typescript">
            // Game.ts
            private refresh(): void {
              // ...
              this.mainSong.play();
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Now we're playing the main song at the start of the game, stopping it
          when the player dies, and starting it again from the beginning when
          the player restarts. Let's start adding some sound effects, starting
          with firing cookies.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-typescript">
            // Player.ts
            // setup
            fireSound: HTMLAudioElement = new Audio("laser.wav");

            // constructor
            this.fireSound.preload = "auto";

            private fire(): void {
              if (!this.fireSound.paused) {
                this.fireSound.currentTime = 0; // Restart the sound if it is playing
              }
              this.fireSound.play();
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          The <code class="lang-typescript">preload</code> attribute lets us
          make a suggestion to the browser, which it may or may not choose to
          follow, to load the audio file as soon as the page loads. This
          increases the chances that we won't have any delay the first time the
          user fires a cookie and plays the sound. Playing the sound is not
          quite as straightforward here as it was with the main song. If we were
          to only call
          <code class="lang-typescript">this.fireSound.play()</code>, we would
          find that if we fired multiple cookies in quick succession, we
          wouldn't hear the sound played for every cookie. If we call
          <code class="lang-typescript">play</code> on an audio element that is
          already playing, nothing happens. Since we want to hear the sound for
          every fired cookie, we have to first check to see if the sound is
          currently being played, (the
          <code class="lang-typescript">paused</code> attribute will be set to
          <code class="lang-typescript">true</code> when the file is finished
          playing), and if it is, we'll just tell it to start over at the
          beginning by setting the
          <code class="lang-typescript">currentTime</code> to zero. If it's not
          already playing, we can just call
          <code class="lang-typescript">play</code> like normal.
        </p>
        <p>Now we can work on the impact sounds for our enemies.</p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-typescript">
            // Enemy.ts
            // setup
            dingSound: HTMLAudioElement = new Audio("ding.ogg");
            popSound: HTMLAudioElement = new Audio("pop.mp3");
            splatSound: HTMLAudioElement = new Audio("splat.wav");

            // constructor
            this.dingSound.preload = "auto";
            this.popSound.preload = "auto";
            this.splatSound.preload = "auto";

            ding(): void {
              if (!this.dingSound.paused) {
                this.dingSound.currentTime = 0; // Restart the sound if it is playing
              }
              this.dingSound.play();
            }
          
            pop(): void {
              this.popSound.play();
            }
          
            splat(): void {
              this.splatSound.play();
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Enemy damage and destruction is handled by the
          <code class="lang-typescript">Game</code> class, so we have to expose
          some methods here for us to play the enemy's sounds externally. If we
          try to put the audio elements on the
          <code class="lang-typescript">Game</code> class instead, we'll find
          that this will prevent us from playing overlapping sounds for multiple
          enemy impacts. Note that we only have to check the ding sound to see
          if it's already playing. This is going to be the sound for an enemy
          that takes multiple hits to destroy, so it's the only one that can be
          played repeatedly. All the others are one and done, because the enemy
          will be destroyed when they are played. Now let's play these effects
          when our enemies are hit.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="lang-typescript">
            private detectCollisions(): void {
              for (let projectile of this.projectiles) {
                for (let enemy of this.enemies) {
                  if (circleCircleCollisionDetected(projectile, enemy)) {
                    // ...
                    if (enemy.requiredHits === 0) {
                      enemy.isActive = false;
                      if (enemy.stage &lt; 3) {
                        enemy.pop();
                        // ...
                      } else {
                        enemy.splat();
                        // ...
                      }
                    } else {
                      enemy.ding();
                    }
                  }
                }
              }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          And we're done. Enemies now ding, pop, and splat when they are
          damaged/destroyed. Next on our list: splatting the player. I'm sure
          you know exactly how this is going to work by now.
        </p>

          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Since there's only one player, we don't have to handle overlapping
          sounds, and can go ahead and keep this sound in the
          <code class="lang-typescript">Game</code> class. Next, reaching a new
          level.

          We'll loop this sound, since the player can propel for as long as they
          want.

          That does it for sound effects! Let's add the last two bits of music,
